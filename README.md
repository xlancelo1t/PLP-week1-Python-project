# Simple Calculator

This is a basic Python calculator program that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers. The program accepts decimal numbers as input and supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Accepts decimal numbers as input.
- Supports four operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Handles division by zero with an error message.
- Validates operation input and notifies for invalid operations.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number.
3. Enter the second number.
4. Enter the operation you want to perform: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
5. The program will output the result of the calculation.
6. If you try to divide by zero, an error message will be displayed.
7. If you enter an invalid operation symbol, the program will prompt you to enter a valid one.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): /
10.0 / 5.0 = 2.0
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Notes

- The program uses `float` type for inputs to allow decimal calculations.
- Make sure to enter valid numbers and operation symbols.
